# 🔀 Git Rebase vs Merge – Simple Guide for Freshers

### 👨‍💻 Scenario:

You're working on a branch called `mohitkr.ydv`, and the main branch is `master`.

You want to either:

* 🔄 **Get the latest changes from `master`** into your branch, or
* 📤 **Send your branch's changes to `master`**

There are **two ways** to do this: **Merge** or **Rebase**.

---

## ✅ `git merge master`

### 🔹 Meaning:

Bring changes from `master` into your branch **without changing history**.

### 🔹 Command:

```bash
git checkout mohitkr.ydv
git merge master
```

### 🔹 Real-Life Example:

You’re working on a feature. Meanwhile, teammates added new commits to `master`.
You want to **merge** those updates into your branch.

### 🔹 Pros:

* ✔️ Safe
* ✔️ Preserves all commit history
* ✔️ Good for teams

---

## ✅ `git rebase master`

### 🔹 Meaning:

Apply your commits **on top of the latest `master`**. It rewrites history to make it look cleaner.

### 🔹 Command:

```bash
git checkout mohitkr.ydv
git rebase master
```

### 🔹 Real-Life Example:

You want your 5 feature commits to appear **after** the latest changes in `master`, as if you just started your work.

### 🔹 Pros:

* ✔️ Clean, linear history
* ❗ Do **not** use if you've already pushed your branch and others are using it

## 📦 What Happens to Your 5 Local Commits?

Let’s say:

* `master` has: A → B → C
* Your `mohitkr.ydv` branch has 5 commits: D → E → F → G → H

### If you **merge**:

```
master:        A → B → C
                     \
mohitkr.ydv:          D → E → F → G → H
                       \
                        M (merge commit)
```

### If you **rebase**:

```
master:        A → B → C
                          \
mohitkr.ydv:               D' → E' → F' → G' → H'  (new copies of your commits)
```

## 🎯 Summary Table

| Use Case      | Action          | Command             | Result                               |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Stay simple   | Merge changes   | `git merge master`  | Keeps full history with merge commit |
| Clean history | Reapply commits | `git rebase master` | Puts your commits on top of master   |

## ✅ As a Fresher, Which One to Use?

👉 **Use `merge` for now**. It’s safer, especially when working in teams.
Once you're more confident, experiment with `rebase` on **local-only branches**.
