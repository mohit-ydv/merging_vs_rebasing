# merging_vs_rebasing

👇 Scenario:
You are working on a branch called mohitkr.ydv.

The main branch is master.

You want to get the latest changes from master into your branch or send your changes to master when you're done.

There are two ways to do this:

✅ Merging (git merge master)
🧠 Meaning:
Bring changes from master into your branch, without changing history.

🛠️ Command:
bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout mohitkr.ydv
git merge master
📦 Real-life example:
You’re working on a new feature. In the meantime, your team added new features to master.
You want to merge those new features into your branch.

✅ Safe & easy. No history change.
✅ Rebasing (git rebase master)
🧠 Meaning:
Also brings master changes into your branch, but moves your commits to the top like they were written after master.

🛠️ Command:
bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout mohitkr.ydv
git rebase master
📦 Real-life example:
Same as before. But instead of showing:
master → mohitkr.ydv merged here
It makes it look like your branch was started from the latest master, as if you're continuing from there.

✅ Clean history
⚠️ But not good if your branch is already pushed and shared.

🎨 Simple Visual
Let’s say:

master has commits: A → B → C

Your branch mohitkr.ydv has commits: D → E

Merge:
mathematica
Copy
Edit
master:        A → B → C
                     \
mohitkr.ydv:          D → E
                       \
                        F (merge commit)
Rebase:
mathematica
Copy
Edit
master:        A → B → C
                        \
mohitkr.ydv:             D' → E' (as if created after C)
🧠 Easy way to remember:
Action	You want to...	Use this
Stay safe and simple	Combine changes, keep full history	git merge
Clean history	Make it look like your work started from latest master	git rebase (advanced)

👋 My Suggestion as a Fresher:
👉 Use merge for now. It's safer, especially in teams.

If you're working alone on a local branch, you can experiment with rebase to learn more.
